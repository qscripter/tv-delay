				This is an attempt to measure the propagation delay between an event happening on a live television show and that event appearing on your TV at home. The delay is affected by several factors and will be different for each cable or satellite provider, which is why we need your help! The first test will be during the 86th Annual Academy Awards airing on Sunday March 2nd. While viewing the show, leave this window open, select your service provider, and whenever you see the show transition to commercial, press the button below.

				Timing is important for this test, so please press the button as soon as you see the show transition from show content to commercial content. Thanks!
